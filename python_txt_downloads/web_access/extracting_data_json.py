"""
Extracting Data from JSON
In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to
http://www.py4e.com/code3/json2.py. The program will prompt for a URL, read the
JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment
counts from the JSON data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file and enter
the sum below:

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you
the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process
for the assignment.

째째Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json (Sum=2553)
째째Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_200959.json (Sum ends with 4)
You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read
the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url
for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.
